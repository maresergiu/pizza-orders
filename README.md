## About the app

The application is built with React, Redux and React Router.

Libraries I have used:

node-sass - scss
prop-types - for type check
eslint-config-prettie - for linting
eslint-plugin-prettier - for linting
prettier - formater
react-slidedown - for slide down and slide up
joi - for data validation
react-app-polyfill - for ie11 compatibility
react-redux - state management
react-router-dom - for router management
react-toastify - to show alert messages

## Install the app
Run `npm i` in the root folder.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
